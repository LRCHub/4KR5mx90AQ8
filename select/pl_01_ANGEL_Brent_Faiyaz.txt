I look in the mirror
And I see the worst
in parts of me
That I don't want
But I never tell you that
(I never tell you that)
And you look amazing
So how can I stand watching
you be, and not feel small?
Damn,
I wish I could change all that
(I wish I could change all that)
But from what I know,
you'll never go away
Don't ever leave my side,
baby, I'll die
But from what I know,
you're always here to stay
You're an angel in disguise
Living in hell
Then maybe you'll save me
in the end
I need your help
And I'm here if you need mine
(You need mine)
When I'm overwhelmed
I take a vacation in my head
and don't bring no one else
I guess you could come some time
(Come some time)
But from what I know,
you'll never go away
Don't ever leave my side,
girl, I'll die
But from what I know,
you're always here to stay
You're an angel in disguise
An angel, an angel, an angel,
an angel
An angel, an angel, angel, angel
An angel, an angel, an angel,
an angel
(Angel in disguise fell
from the heavens in the sky)
(You're my angel)
An angel, an angel, angel, angel
(Angel in disguise fell
from the heavens in the sky)
(You're my angel)
An angel, an angel, an angel,
an angel
(Angel in disguise fell
from the heavens in the sky)
An angel, an angel, angel, angel
(Angel in disguise fell
from the heavens in the sky)
But from what I know,
you'll never go away
Don't ever leave my side,
girl, I'll die
But from what I know,
you're always here to stay
